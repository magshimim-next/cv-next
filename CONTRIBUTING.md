# Before we Start

We want to thank anyone who wishes to take the time to support this project.

This project was made with the benefit of the Magshimim Next Community in mind. \
Whether it's by giving them a platform to upload and improve their CVs or whether it's to try and play with some web development and penetration testing.

And with that in mind:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We have decided to only allow community members to contribute to the project.
